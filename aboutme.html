            Hi my name is Jonathan Caudill. I am currently going to college at
            <a href="https://kctcs.edu/" target="_blank">Maysville Community and Technical College</a> I am currently a freshman and working
            to get my Bachelors. Right now I do not have alot of accomplishments but one day I will.
            I plan on finishing college and plan while doing college to try and make some apps not
            sure what type to make yet but I plan on making one at some point.
        </p>

        <p>
            Programing languages I have learnt so far are Python, C#, HTML, CSS, A bit of Java Script,
            And a bit of XML. I do not have alot of experience programing right now the first language
            I learnt is Python and I immediately fell inlove I switched what I was originally doing to
            one where I would learn more about programming. I have only been programming for 8 months
            but I have enjoyed it here soon I am going to be learning about Java then I will learn one
            that I get to choose not sure which one I will choose yet but I still have a bit till I have
            to decide.
